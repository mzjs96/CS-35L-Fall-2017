First we decided to let Xilai's Beaglebone act as the server, and mine act as 
the clinet. 
After following the setup process on piazza, we first follow TA's instruction 
to generate the public and private keys:

	ssh-keygen

Next we are prompted to create a password for the the server machine. It is 
intentially left blank by hitting ENTER. Then a new account is created for 
clinet on the server, and create its new directory on the server:

	sudo useradd -d /home/newuser -m jiashu

Next create a password the new user jiashu

	sudo passwd jiashu

The password is set as "qwerty" for simplicity.

Next is to create a new .ssh directory for the new user created:

	cd /home/newuser
	sudo mkdir .ssh

Next is to authorize ownership and permission of the .ssh directory to the new 
	user jiashu

	sudo chown -R jiashu .ssh
	sudo chmod 700 .ssh

The server part is done. Next is to setup on the client side:

First we need to look up the ip address of the machine:

	ifconfig

The IP address of the machine is given as: 15.85.79.33

For the client machine, first is to setup the public and private keys for ssh. 
Then add the public key to the server's ssh folder

	ssh-keygen

Then make a copy of the public key to the server's ssh folder.

	ssh-copy-id -i jiashu@15.85.79.33

Next is to add the private key to authentication agent.
	ssh-add

At this point we have encountered a problem. The output was "Could not open a 
connection to authentication agent" 
Later we figured out that for my machine(client) I forgot to implement "agent 
on" during the setup process.

Now after setting passphrase the for the new account by hitting "qwerty", log 
in the server using ssh:

	ssh jiashu@15.85.79.33

Now i have the authorization to access the server and my drectory, if I run

	xterm

the xterm shell will pop up.

To see the connection run

	who 

command on the server to see currently connected users.
The display shows that the IP address of 15.85.79.33, which agrees with the ip 
address in ifconfig. Now we have confirmed that my client has successfully log 
into my partner (Xilai's) server.

Then do the reverse for similar steps. Let my machine be the server and 
Xilai's machine as the client and do the same process and turns out to be the 
correct behavior.
