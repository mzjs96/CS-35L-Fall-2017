Q1:
Brady's patch removed the line "case_long_iso_time_style" because it is a
label for the goto command, and there is a duplicate of this label in the
patch which is to be deleted. Therefore, this line can be removed without
causing problem. It is not necessary to remove this line because the code will
still run the same and nothing will be affected.

Q2:
Since the modification will force the date to be displayed in a specific 
format, for locales that do not have a translation, foreign language speakers
could not understand it. On the other hand, I noticed that the modification 
replaces the time by year for the files that are already one year old.

Q3:
When I invoked randline.py on an empty file, the output is shown as following:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

The index error occurs when chooseline() is called.
There are 0 line to be accessed by the class randline. The error is called 
because the seq is empty.

Q4:
Run randline.py under python3 gives the following:

  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

The syntax error occurs because in python 3 the IOError is merged into OSError.
To correct it, change into the following:

except OSError as err:
       parser.error("OS error: {0}".format(err))
