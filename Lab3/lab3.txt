Get the file using wget
Command: wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Unzip:
Command: tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

Install the file. Read INSALL:
Command: cd coreutils-7.6/
		 ./configure --prefix=/u/ee/ugrad/jiashu/coreutils

Compile the program:
Command: make install

Set the LC_ALL environment variable:
export LC_ALL='en_US.UTF-8'

Go to directory:
cd ../coreutils/bin

./ls -l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 960632 2017-08-03 06:36 /bin/bash
Apparently, the output of date format is not what we have expected.

A file called patch.diff was made using emacs. 
Before running the patch command, the path in line 2 and 3 needs to be changed
to:
./coreutils7.6/src/ls.c

To patch the file use the following command:
Command: patch -p0 < patch. diff

However, I have encountered an error output as follow:

patching file ./src/ls.c
Hunk #1 FAILED at 2014 (different line endings).
Hunk #2 FAILED at 2030 (different line endings).
2 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file ./src/ls.c.rej

After careful scrutinizing and learning from piazza for reference, I realized
that using emacs to create a file will result in corruption of the patch file. 
Then I chose to use vim to create the patch file.
The patch ran successfully after the second trialï¼š

patching file ./coreutils-7.6/src/ls.c
Hunk #1 succeeded at 2013 (offset -1 lines).
patch unexpectedly ends in middle of line
Hunk #2 succeeded at 2028 with fuzz 1 (offset -1 lines).

Next is to recompile the program using the make command
Command: make install

For a recently modified file:

Before the patch:
ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jiashu eeugrad 10014650 2017-10-17 09:12 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

After the patch:
ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz 
-rw-r--r-- 1 jiashu eeugrad 10014650 Oct 17 09:12 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

For an at least one year old file: 

Use touch comamnd to modify the time coreutils-7.6.tar.gz file:

touch -t 1501010000 coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

So now the date of the file is changed to Jan 1 2015

Before the patch:
Command: ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jiashu eeugrad 10014650 01012015 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

After the patch:
Command: ls -l ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 jiashu eeugrad 10014650 Jan  1  2015 ./coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

From the results, we have seen that the output for format for dates has been
corrected.
